/**
 * ScreenCaptureView, a UIView subclass that periodically samples its current display
 * and stores it as a UIImage available through the 'currentScreen' property.  The
 * sample/update rate can be configured (within reason) by setting the 'frameRate'
 * property.
 *
 * This class can also be used to record real-time video of its subviews, using the
 * 'startRecording' and 'stopRecording' methods.  A new recording will overwrite any
 * previously made recording file, so if you want to create multiple recordings per
 * session (or across multiple sessions) then it is your responsibility to copy/back-up
 * the recording output file after each session.
 *
 * To use this class, you must link against the following frameworks:
 *
 *  - AssetsLibrary
 *  - AVFoundation
 *  - CoreGraphics
 *  - CoreMedia
 *  - CoreVideo
 *  - QuartzCore
 *
